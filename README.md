### *"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."*

This is a **fabric-only mod** that aims to recreate the wonder and allure of classic magic mods. It is inspired by historical alchemy, and will have strong emphasis on visuals and automation.

> Currently Pre-Alpha - Incomplete, but showcases some of the ever increasing number of blocks, items, and worldgen features.

> The Biome system since Minecraft 1.18/1.18.1 is still in development, so terrain work will not officially start until at 1.18.2 at the earliest.

## Planned Features
- **Automatable alchemy** for extracting energy from materials
- **Wisps**, sentient beings that grant the player abilities and control the balance of the world
- **Staves** with selectable foci; provides unique tools and weapons
- **World generation** - resources, biomes, tree types, and structures
- **Progression system** based on exploration and crafting (rather than scanning and research)
- A **really special book** that hints at lore and progression as the player discovers more
- **Good looking blocks** - loads of wood types, building blocks, furniture, and lighting options
- **Really cool effects** for staves, alchemy, and wherever else I can make something look good

## Inspiration
- **Actual alchemy** - many features are direct implementations of ancient scientific tools and terminology
- **BiomesOP** - foliage and custom biome implementation
- **Thaumcraft** - what magic mod isn't?

## Currently Implemented
- Base models for workbench, staves, alembic, and vitriol
- Four new tree types with entirely custom (but work-in-progress) shapes
    - Their respective log/wood/stripped variants, leaves, plank variants, stairs, and slabs
- Crafting recipes, furnace recipes, and blast furnace recipes
- Base texture work

## Common Questions
- **When will this be done?**

Not sure. I'm a novice modder and life is a thing. Major updates will be on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/trufflezmc); in the meantime, you can always [check commits](https://github.com/trufflezmc/trufflez-arcanum/commits/master).

- **Will you support older Minecraft versions?**

This mod depends on features from 1.17 and the upcoming 1.19 update, so, no.

- **Can you implement X feature?**

Maybe! I'm always open to suggestions. There will eventually be a Discord server to make this process easier.

- **Did X feature rip off Y mod?**

Probably not. Each feature was designed from a blank slate with tons of historical research. For this reason, many concepts and terminology overlap other mods.


- **Will this be available on Forge?**

No.
